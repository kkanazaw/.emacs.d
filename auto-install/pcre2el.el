;; History:
;;   This was created out of an answer to a stackoverflow question:
;;      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9118183/elisp-mechanism-for-converting-pcre-regexps-to-emacs-regexps
;;
;; Documentation:
;;   - Using the conversion function:
;;
;;     Use the following function to perform a conversion:
;;       (pcre-to-elisp "(abc|def)\\w+\\d+")
;;     Produces:
;;       "\(abc\|def\)\w+[0-9]+"
;;
;;   - Interactive replacements:
;;
;;     You may want to perform the following key bindings if you
;;     prefer PCRE generally over the elisp counterparts:
